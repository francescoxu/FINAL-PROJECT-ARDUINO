DOCUMENTATION OF THE DESIGN
LED MATRIX ANIMATION

For my project I used the 8x8 RGB LED matrix named WS2811, The reason for my choice it's because I liked the idea of using it to create animations and characters. After I watched some videos on youtube, I was sure that it was going to be my final project. I bought three WS2811 and some wires. The purpose of my project is to create a perpetual animation on the matrix and then create a case to put it in and cover it with an acrylic sheet, so I can put in my room.
