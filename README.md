# FINAL-PROJECT-ARDUINO

##Introduction

For my project I used the 8x8 RGB LED matrix named WS2811, The reason for my choice it's because I liked the idea of using it to create animations and characters. After I watched some videos on youtube, I was sure that it was going to be my final project. I bought three WS2811 and some wires. The purpose of my project is to create a perpetual animation on the matrix and then create a case to put it in and cover it with an acrylic sheet, so I can put in my room.

First of all I needed to obtain the materials, since I can't go out during this period, I searched on amazon I found the WS2811 and I bought three of them, then I got the jumping wires on amazon too.

Then I did a research on how to setup the LED matrix, as a result I downloaded an arduino library to control these RGB LED, named FastLED.h. This library is used to efficently controlling the LED. After learning how control the matrix I started playing around. 
Then my first sketch is copied from a GIF of Mario&Luigi found on the web.

I used microsoft excel to simplify my coding on arduino, because I can find the LED postion (or pixel) in an easier way.
